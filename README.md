🤖 Generative Text for Customer Support Automation

This project demonstrates how to automate customer support using **generative AI**—specifically, **GPT-3.5 via the Groq API**. It enables fast, accurate, and personalized responses to customer queries, reducing the burden on human agents while improving response time and user satisfaction.

📌 Project Overview

This case study explores the use of **generative models** in customer support automation with two key use cases:

1. Automated Response Generation

* **Problem**: Customer support agents are overwhelmed with repetitive, simple queries.
* **Solution**: Use a generative model (GPT-3.5) to respond to FAQs and common issues automatically.

2. Personalized Customer Engagement

* **Problem**: Customers want responses that reflect their history and preferences.
* **Solution**: Generate personalized replies using available customer data and past interactions.
